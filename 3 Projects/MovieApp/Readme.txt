this is a project to help practice my HTML/CSS skills, so i decided to make 3 movie websites
with 3 different styles to see what i can do.


Example 1
Very basic, was trying to make it look good without using pictures.

Example 2
Made a webpage for when u click on the movie, shows movie description, title and other
popular movies below

Example 3
for this webpage i tried to make it look similar to netflix style

** photos holds pictures of each webpage **
